CURRY CHICKEN

For four persons:

*Steps #1 and #a are done simultaneously.

1.	Fry two onions cut in "half moons" in a covered casserole with olive oil covering the bottom (medium fire).

2.	Once the onions are soft throw in two tomatoes in piezes and leave them covered a while longer.

3.	Add a spirt of katchup, another of wine vinegar, four soup spoons of curry powder (strongly recommend Sherwood hot curry brand), a bit of cayenne (how much depending on how spicy you wish the curry to be) and a chicken bouillon cube.

a.	Boil an entire chicken cut in pieces.

b.	Remove skin and bones from it (make sure to save some water from boiling the chicken).


4c.	Add the chicken to the mix.

5d.	Tear the chicken, add some water from boiling it previously and let it boil for 30 minutes.

Notes:
-	It's better to fewer water and keep adding when necessary so it doesn't dry, than adding too much water.
-	It tastes better if it's made from one day to the next.
-	It's accompanied with white rize, raisings and pine nuts (the latter two are added when serving).
-	For each 1,5kg of chicken you'll need around three cups of rize.
